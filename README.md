# README

### Brief
This repo contains source code for my second OpenGL project. I hope to render a bobbing square at first, and then I'll aim to implement more.

### Helpful References
 1. Manually include OpenGL API function link code with [GLAD Setup](https://rpxomi.github.io/).
 2. Get started with GLFW and OpenGL with [OpenGL Tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window)
 3. Dependency List:
    - GLFW from the GLFW site
    - OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) from GLAD
